# RomCom

### Project Overview

  The goal for RomCom was to integrate skills acquired over the last 2 weeks to create a Browser app that can randomly generate romance covers with randomly assigned names and taglines. To complete this project we employed a working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, the DOM, event listeners, and event handlers. During this project we dove head first into HTML and CSS and acquired a working proficiency in querying DOM elements and manipulating those same elements. We gained skills in using JS Classes to create instances and pass in dynamic parameters and arguments.

This page displays all of the covers that you have saved. If you would like to delete a cover, double-click on it. (Be careful, though, this is permanent!)   Feeling creative? Click on the "Make Your Own Cover" button!
## Make Your Own Cover View

This form will allow you to create a custom cover to your specifications. Simply add a link to the image of your choice in the Cover field, then add a title and two descriptors for your tagline. After all forms are filled, click the "Make My Book" button to view your new creation.  
This will take you back to the Home View, where you can save your new cover, or generate new random covers.
