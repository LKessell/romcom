# RomCom

### Project Overview

  The goal for RomCom was to integrate skills acquired over the last 2 weeks to create a Browser app that can randomly generate romance covers with randomly assigned names and taglines. To complete this project we employed a working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, the DOM, event listeners, and event handlers. During this project we dove head first into HTML and CSS and acquired a working proficiency in querying DOM elements and manipulating those same elements. We gained skills in using JS Classes to create instances and pass in dynamic parameters and arguments.
